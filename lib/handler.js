/**
 * A higher-order function that returns a request handler for GraphQL queries.
 * It accepts both a GraphQL and Mirage schema along with a hash of options.
 * Options include:
 *
 * 1. `resolvers` - A resolver map for cases where the default Mirage resolvers
 *    aren't sufficient. Such cases include: resolving root-level scalar values,
 *    sorting records and complex mutations.
 * 2. `context` - A context object that GraphQL will pass into each resolver. A
 *     common use case for this is to supply current user information to
 *     resolvers. By default, whatever context you pass in will be appended with
 *     a reference to the Mirage schema and the request being handled.
 * 3. `root` - A root level value that GraphQL will use as the parent object for
 *    fields at the highest level.
 *
 * The GraphQL schema param may be a string, an AST or an executable
 * GraphQL schema. This library ensures the schema is executable in any case.
 *
 * This also ensures models are added to the Mirage schema for each appropriate
 * type from the GraphQL schema. Since the GraphQL schema already defines types
 * and relationships, it may be redundant to define Mirage models when using
 * GraphQL. You may still define Mirage models, though, if you'd like.
 *
 * Lastly, it creates a field resolver that GraphQL will use to resolve every
 * field from a query. If an optional resolver isn't supplied for a given field,
 * this field resolver will be used. It does its best to resolve queries and
 * mutations automatically based on the information from the GraphQL schema and
 * the records in Mirage's database.
 *
 * @function createGraphQLHandler
 * @param {Object|string} graphQLSchema
 * @param {Object} mirageSchema
 * @param {{context: Object, resolvers: Object, root: Object}}
 * @returns {graphQLHandler}
